The dog's prominent feature is its oversized nose, which is slightly pink at the nostrils. The nose is pointing upwards as the dog sniffs the air, and its mouth is slightly ajar, revealing a hint of its tongue. The dog's ears are folded back, and its dark brown eyes are alert, looking directly at the viewer.\n\nThe bag, with a faded floral pattern, is placed on the kitchen floor, which is made of light hardwood. To the left of the bag, there's a kitchen island with a white granite countertop, holding a toaster, a blender, and a few cookbooks. On the right side of the bag, there's a kitchen cabinet with a slightly ajar door, revealing a stack of white plates. In the background, a large window lets in plenty of natural light, casting a warm glow on the scene. A few strands of sunlight filter through the window, illuminating the dust particles dancing in the air.
